Two methods were used in this project for sentimental analysis. 
* Polarity Score using positive words and negative words(Conventional Method), 
* DeepLearning model - BERT(State of Art)
The accuracy of the models were compared. The BERT model shows better results than the polarity score. Still, Further improvement can be applied to the model for better accuracy.
**Improvisation Ideas**
* Try to Apply Large Language Models
* Train model with many epochs
